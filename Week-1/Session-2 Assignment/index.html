      <section>
        <h3>Topography</h3>

        <h3>Founding</h3>
        <p>
          Archaeological excavations suggest that Native Americans have
          inhabited the Seattle area for at least 4,000 years. By the time the
          first European settlers arrived, the people (subsequently called the
          Duwamish tribe) occupied at least seventeen villages in the areas
          around Elliott Bay.

          Seattle has a history of boom-and-bust cycles, like many other cities
          near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources. Seattle has
          risen several times economically, then gone into precipitous decline,
          but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid
          infrastructure.
